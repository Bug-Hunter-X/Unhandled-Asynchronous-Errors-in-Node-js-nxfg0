This repository demonstrates a common issue in Node.js applications: unhandled asynchronous errors.  The `bug.js` file contains code that simulates an asynchronous operation which can throw an error.  This error isn't handled properly, which can lead to crashes. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with proper error handling using async/await and try...catch blocks, showcasing best practices for preventing such issues.
